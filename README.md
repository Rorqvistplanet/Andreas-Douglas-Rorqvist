# Andreas-Douglas-Rorqvist
Born: 1986 and raised at Näset, Gothenburg (Sweden) and suffering from borderline personality disorder aswell as asperger syndrom and fighting against a heavy drug abuse and addiction problem since the day a lost my brother in a fire accident. But just sitting down starting a new painting or sketching project is something that for me is relaxing. ”The art of creation” i think somebody said one time ago. Well im always been in to art already as a young guy and always felt i had some kind of talent for it so i thought about starting a blog here on WordPress.com hoping i can inspire some people! Welcome to Andreas Rörqvist’s blog and artwork here on rorqvistplanet!
